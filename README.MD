This is a client for the splix.io website.
This has been possible thanks to the publication of the source code by the
author of that website. See https://github.com/jespertheend/splix.

The plugins have been taken from
 - WrongChat - https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/411350-wrong-chat (no license found)
 - Zoom - not really, taken I wrote this one my self. Definetely inpsired from
 plugins on GreasyFork/shared by other members of the splix community.

The rest was written by me (Tartasprint).
